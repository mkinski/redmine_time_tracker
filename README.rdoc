or to make a symbolic link <tt><redmine_root>/plugin_assets/redmine_time_tracker</tt> pointing to <tt>redmine_time_tracker/assets</tt>

== Unnstall

1. Setup the database using the migrations. 
   Redmine version 2.0:   
   <tt>rake rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production NAME=redmine_time_tracker VERSION=0</tt>
   < 2.0:
   <tt>rake db:migrate_plugins RAILS_ENV=production NAME=redmine_time_tracker VERSION=0</tt>
2. Remove folder from plugin directory

== Usage

To be able to use a time tracker, a user must have the 'log time' permission.
Then, the current time tracker information are displayed in the top right menu, next to the user
info.

These information are context dependant:
- If the user does not have a running time tracker yet, a message telling so will be displayed.
- If the user does not have a running time tracker yet but he is displaying an issue, then the
  'start' action will be displayed.
- If the user has a running time tracker, the current spent time is displayed (and refreshed
  periodically) next to the tracked issue number. The 'pause' or the 'resume' action will be
  displayed as well as the 'stop' one too. Stopping the time tracker will redirect the user to the
  standard time logging page with the 'hours' field filled with the time tracker value. This way, we
  rely on existing and well known behaviours.

To be noted that these actions are available in the issues list context menu too (right click in the
issues list).

A 'list' action is displayed in the menu too. This action will redirect the user to a page listing
his time tracker and other user's ones if the 'view others time trackers' right is set.
From this list, the user can 'delete' his time tracker (or the other user's ones if the 'delete
others time trackers' permission is set).

The plugin settings page allows to define the spent time refresh rate and the status transition to
apply when a time tracker is started.
For example, if a transition 'New' -> 'In progress' is added, starting a time tracker on an issue having
the 'New' status will automatically change it to 'In progress'.
